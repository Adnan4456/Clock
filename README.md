## Clock

The custom clock is an Android application developed using Jetpack Compose, leveraging the power of Canvas for custom drawing. This application visually represents a clock with dynamic hour, minute, and second hands that update in real time.
# Key Features
Real-time Updates: The clock hands (hour, minute, and second) update in real time to reflect the current time.
Custom Drawing with Canvas: Utilizes Jetpack Compose's Canvas component to draw the clock's face and hands.
Composable Function: The entire clock is encapsulated within a composable function, making it easy to integrate into other Compose layouts.
